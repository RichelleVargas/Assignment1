Assignment1
===========

The objective of the assignment was to design an object less than 4cm in any direction on OpenSCAD
(.scad file can be found in "source" folder) and export it as an .stl file (found in "export" folder) 
to be printed on a RepRap 3D printer.
The object I designed has a hollow going through it - a string can be thread through to make it a part of a necklace
or chain.
